# Script

We're creating a game named **DreadNought** and it is based upon the classic game of **Battleship**

#### History

Battleship is a two player strategy guessing game.

It originally came about around **World War One** and was played on with pencil and paper.

The game as we know it today was released by **Milton Bradley** in 1967 as a plastic board game, however now you can play it on virtually any computer. 

#### What is Battleship?

In **Battleship** each player has a 10x10 board of tiles where, before the game begins, they may place their 5 ships of varying lengths wherever they like on the board, however ships cannot be placed such that they overlap with each other.

On their turn a player chooses a position on the board to fire a "missile" onto the opponent's board and are told if they missed or hit a ship.

A ship is sunk once all of its sections have been hit.

A player wins once they sink all of their opponents ships.
