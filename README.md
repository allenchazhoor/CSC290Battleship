## Introduction

**DreadNought** is a game based upon well-known classic game of **[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship)**. In this two-player game you place *ships* of varying lengths onto a grid of 10x10 tiles. In this game each player is not allowed to see the other player's board, instead the players take turns firing *missiles* onto the opponents board and are told if they hit a ship or not. ***The objective of the game*** is to sink all of your opponents ships, at which point you have won.
